_Transfering Meeting notes into Github_

Our initial velocity was 0.4

In the first iteration, 17.5 Hours of work were completed in around 40 hours. (We had intended to work a total of 49 hours between the 7 of us, but due to midterms we did not end up working that much)

$$velocity = \frac{17.5}{40} = 0.4375$$

With our new velocity of **0.4375**, we have enough room in the second iteration to complete all of the remaining tasks.

_Note_ - We did not complete User story 2 during iteration one. This user story got us a little stumped so it had to be pushed back to Iteration 2.
