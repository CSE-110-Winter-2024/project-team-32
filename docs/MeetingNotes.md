# Meeting Notes

## Meeting 1 - Feb 7

- Haven't been as productive, since waiting for Daniel and Tyler to finish US#0
- Everyone needs to assign themselves to some user stories and start getting to work (Everyone has a bunch of midterms but try your best ðŸ˜¢)
- Need to approve pull request for US#0
- US#0 did not implement the UI using a fragment, it was just in the constraint layout of the default main activity - may need to refactor later?

## Meeting 2 - Feb 14

- Velocity was recalculated to be ~0.43, so keep that in mind, we still have a bit of breathing room in iteration at least
- User story 2 and 5 both required actively keeping track of the time, which we're struggling to figure out how to do
- Ideas for US2 / US5:
  - AlarmManager?
  - TextClock
  - Making your own thread manually?
  - Executor?
- Realized that we need to have a button that advances the day by 1 in our finished product, as according to the rubric, so we need to add that as a task at some point
- People have been forgetting to assign themselves to tasks since they aren't working on it on their computer, try to remember to assign yourself to the task even if you're pair programming on the other person's laptop
