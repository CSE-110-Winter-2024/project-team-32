# Team 32 - Successorator 

---

This is team 32's implementation of the Successorator application.

Successorator enables user to view a list of tasks, add tasks, and checkoff tasks.
Tasks will order themselves with completed tasks at the bottom of the list, and uncompleted tasks at the top of the list, ordered based on when they were created.
If you un-checkoff a task it will rise to the top of the list.

Tasks that have been completed are removed every day at 2:00AM

## Velocity Calculations for Milestones

### Milestone 1
* **Predicted velocity**: 0.4
* **Justification**: Itâ€™s midterms week, and everyone in the group is enrolled in multiple classes that will take up their time. This means that there is a lot less time they can spend on the project. Additionally, many of us are new to Android and software development in general so there's a bit of a learning curve. We're estimating this figure to play it safe since we're not too sure what we're doing right now.

### Milestone 2
* **Calculated velocity**: 0.41
* **Justification**: During milestone 1, we completed 26.5 hours worth of productive work in 65 hours (7 hours each for the 7 of us the first iteration, and then a bit less the second iteration because we had less work, resulting in about 2.5 - 3 hours each for the second iteration). This makes our overall velocity for milestone 1 equal to 26.5 / 65 which is around 0.41, so we will use that as our velocity for this milestone.
