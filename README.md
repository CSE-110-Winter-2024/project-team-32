# Team 32 - Successorator 

---

This is team 32's implementation of the Successorator application.

Successorator enables user to view a list of tasks, add tasks, and checkoff tasks.
Tasks will order themselves with completed tasks at the bottom of the list, and uncompleted tasks at the top of the list, ordered based on when they were created.
If you un-checkoff a task it will rise to the top of the list.

Tasks that have been completed are removed every day at 2:00AM
